# Gymanstic App Manger 🤸‍♀

As software developers, our team is thrilled to be working on an innovative app tailored for gymnastic coaches. Our goal is to provide coaches with a seamless experience in creating, editing, and managing lesson plans for their courses. This app brings efficiency to the forefront, allowing coaches to easily duplicate successful plans, save and load sessions, and print plans for quick reference. The user-friendly interface ensures a smooth navigation experience, empowering coaches to focus more on the intricacies of their coaching rather than grappling with complex software.
